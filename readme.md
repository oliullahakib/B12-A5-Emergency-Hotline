1.Ans:
**getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll** all are use to get element from DOM. They have some differece like **getElementById** and **querySelector** give you only the specific element.But they take different aregument. **getElementById** take a ID as aregument in the outher side **querySelector** take a CSS seclector as argument. **getElementById** give you only the elemnt with specific ID.But **querySelector** give you first Element with The ID,Class Or tag etc valid CSS selector. Where **getElementById** And **querySelector** give you only one specific Element, on the other side **getElementsByClassName** and **querySelectorAll** Give you the collection of Element. **getElementsByClassName** give you a HTMl-Collection and **querySelectorAll** give you a NodeList. By using them you can get more then one Element.
